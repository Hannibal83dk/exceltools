# exceltools
A small package to manage excell sheets in R

Uses a popup file select window for selecting excel file
Displays available sheets in the file and lets you select one to load.

Posibility for easy saving of multiple datatables as sheets to excels file wilt automatic file ending, so only name is required.

Are not able to append sheets to an existing file, since this will destroy preveous formulas and formatting, so overwrite should be set to FALSE by default.

Any commments are welcome
