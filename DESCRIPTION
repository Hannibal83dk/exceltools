Description: A small package to manage excell sheets in R
    If no path is given as a parameter a popup file select window appear for selecting excel file. If no sheet number is given as a parameter, 
    available sheets will be shown in the command line and to let you select one to load.
    Posibility for easy saving of multiple datatables as sheets to excels file wilt automatic file ending, so only name is required.
    Are not able to append sheets to an existing file, since this will destroy preveous formulas and formatting, so overwrite should be set to FALSE by default.
